# seqbio-variant-scoring
A method for scoring variants based on relationships of individuals.

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Idea here is to start with a simple R package continaing the functions needed, so that we could import and apply in different workflows or locations as required.
Could incorporate related code from pedigree ranking: https://github.com/SequenceBio/seqbio-pedigree-ranking
and build a scoring/ranking package that we can host on sb-conda.
If ideas are deemed to have external merit, we could make the repository public at some point to add the methods to a manuscript.
