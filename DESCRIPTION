Description: 
    The seqbio.variant.scoring R package is meant to aid in comparative evaluation of families 
    and candidate variants in rare-variant association studies. The package can be used for 
    two methodologically overlapping but distinct purposes. First, the prior to any genetic or genomic 
    evaluation, evaluation of relative detection power of pedigrees, can direct recruitment 
    efforts by showing which unsampled individuals would be the most meaningful additions to a study. 
    Second, after sequencing and analysis,  variants based on association with disease status 
    and familial relationships of individuals, aids in variant prioritization.
