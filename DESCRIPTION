Description: 
    The seqbio.variant.scoring R package is meant to aid in comparative evaluation of families 
    and candidate variants in rare-variant association studies. The package can be used for 
    two methodologically overlapping but distinct purposes: First, the prior to any genetic/genomic 
    evaluation, evaluation of relative detection power of pedigrees, can direct recruitment 
    efforts by showing which unsampled individuals would be the most meaningful additions to a study. 
    Second, after sequencing and analysis,  variants based on association with disease status 
    and familial relationships of individuals, aids in variant prioritization
