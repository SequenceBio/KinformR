Description: 
    This R package is designed to score rare variants, assigning values based on 
    the disease status of individuals, the presence or absence of a rare variant 
    in those individuals, and their pairwise coefficients of relatedness. 
    The package uses a custom formula to assign value to a variant that gives 
    more weight to shared variants common to distantly related affected 
    individuals. The variant status for unaffected individuals can optionally 
    be considered as well, with the highest scoring values being given to 
    closely related individuals that do not share a variant of interst. 
    Since variants can be incompletely penetrant, the scoring can be based 
    solely on the affected individuals, or the weight of unaffected evidence 
    can be customized.
