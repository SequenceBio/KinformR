Description:
    The KinformR R package is meant to aid in comparative evaluation of families
    and candidate variants in rare-variant association studies. The package can be used for
    two methodologically overlapping but distinct purposes. First, the prior to any genetic or genomic
    evaluation, evaluation of relative detection power of pedigrees, can direct recruitment
    efforts by showing which unsampled individuals would be the most meaningful additions to a study.
    Second, after sequencing and analysis,  variants based on association with disease status
    and familial relationships of individuals, aids in variant prioritization.
